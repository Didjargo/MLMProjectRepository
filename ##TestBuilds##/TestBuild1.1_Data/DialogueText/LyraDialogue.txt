Hi, I'm Lyra. I'll talk to you if you stand near and press "space"
Currently I don't do anything except test dialouge.
This is a test of a particularly long string to see if it will try to wrap, but sadly I doubt it will.
Actualy it looks like that works now...
I suppose an idexing system for my dialouge would make this more interesting...
Now I need to say something really long to test font size and see if we can have three rows of text in the box, but why three?
Pretty cool. Would you believe all my dialouge is stored in a text file?
I hear a new menu system has been implemented.
You should check it out with "esc" and use "space" to select options
Now go explore or something, I'm gonna find a unicorn!
